About
---
Little Barbershop is a space created purely for males who appreciate premium quality, attention to detail, and a flawless look. Is known in the Santa Monica community as a place where class and customer satisfaction reign supreme. Guests can expect to receive a haircut that is tailored to the needs of each individual client. Our barbers are experienced, skilled, and have a love for the craft that sets them apart from other shops. We offer hot towel, straight razor shaves that are one of a kind and leave our guests feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and ready for life's narrative. Little Barbershop is not just a barbershop, it's an experience.
